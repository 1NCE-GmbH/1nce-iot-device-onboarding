The Open Source project has one clear but distinctive focus - Enabling AWS customers to automatically onboard their IoT Devices into the AWS IoT Core (device-onboarding-as-a-Service) following a self-managed approach. Customers with the "1NCE Connect" product can map their IoT devices via SIM cards to certificates for the AWS IoT Core. The certificates allow publishing, subscription, and connection to AWS IoT Core MQTT broker.

Certificates and other credentials for MQTT subscription can be retrieved from HTTP GET endpoint by using the SIM-as-an-Identity service. Service allows using a single endpoint for all devices. Individual certificates are returned to each device depending on the IP address, that is being used in the 1NCE network.

<br /><br /><br />
## Quick start

#### Prerequisites
At least one 1NCE SIM card and access to the 1NCE.com portal. Access to an AWS account and the possibility to rollout a CFN stack is required.

#### Step-by-step process

1. Log in to your AWS account
2. Choose a Region with IoT Core service support
3. Go to Cloudformation > Stacks
4. Select Create Stack "With new resources"
5. As Amazon S3 URL use "https://device-onboarding-prod-cloudformation-templates.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/latest/device-onboarding-main.yaml"
6. Fill in stack name and [parameters](#input-parameters)
7. When the stack is rolled out, go to Systems Manager > Parameter store and get value from "openvpn-onboarding-proxy-server". This value is the onboarding endpoint URL.
8. Call the onboarding endpoint URL with a HTTP GET request and receive your device onboarding credentials. The request should be sent via 1NCE mobile network.
9. Use the Credentials to connect to the AWS IoT Core MQTT broker.

### Input Parameters

##### ManagementApiUsername, ManagementApiPassword

## SNS

Two SNS topics are created where customers can subscribe to receive notifications on successful events or failures.

###  Failure Topic

On this topic notifications will be sent on such failures:
- [SIM Retrieval Lambda](#sim-retrieval-lambda) fails to retrieve SIM from 1NCE API.
- [SIM Retrieval Lambda](#sim-retrieval-lambda) fails to publish SIM changes to [SIMs create SQS](#sims-createfifo) or [SIMs disable SQS](#sims-disablefifo).
- [Create SIM Lambda](#create-sim-lambda) fails in case if an error occurs during IoT Core resources (thing, cert) creation or SIM creation in DB.
- [Disable SIM lambda](#disable-sim-lambda) sends failures if an error occurs during SIM disable.

Example message:
```
{
  "timestamp":1680526955876,
  "message": "Incorrect username or password"
}
```
### Success Topic

On this topic notifications will be sent on such events:
- [Create SIM Lambda](#create-sim-lambda) sends details about successfully created SIMs.
- [Disable SIM lambda](#disable-sim-lambda) sends details about successfully disabled SIMs.

Example messages:
```
{
  "iccid": "8988280666001099538",
  "ip": "10.242.0.3",
  "timestamp": 1680618078888,
  "message": "SIM enabled"
}

{
  "iccid": "8988280666001099538",
  "ip": "10.242.0.3",
  "timestamp": 1680618079888,
  "message": "SIM disabled"
}
```

## SQS

Two SQS queues are created where [SIM Retrieval Lambda](#sim-retrieval-lambda) is posting messages.

### sims-create.fifo
In this SQS messages are posted for SIMs that need to be created. Messages are processed by [Create SIM Lambda](#create-sim-lambda).

### sims-disable.fifo
In this SQS messages are posted for SIMs that need to be disabled. Messages are processed by [Disable SIM lambda](#disable-sim-lambda).

## SSM

 SSM parameters are used to exchange the values with [EC2 Instance](#ec2). SSM parameters names are configurable. Those contains:
- Parameter where API Gateway Endpoint URL is stored. Used by [EC2 Instance](#ec2) Nginx server.
- Parameter where API Gateway Endpoint Path is stored. Used by [EC2 Instance](#ec2) Nginx server configuration.
- Parameter filled by [EC2 Instance](#ec2). It contains the Proxy Server endpoint for the device onboarding. This is the actual onboarding endpoint where customers' devices should request the onboarding details.
- Breakout Region in 1NCE Portal. Used by [EC2 Instance](#ec2) for correct configuration download.

## Secrets Manager

Secrets manager secrets where values for [EC2 Instance](#ec2) are being stored. Secrets names are configurable. Those contain:
- Secret where 1NCE Management API credentials are being stored.
- Secret where 1NCE OpenVPN credentials are being stored.
## Lambdas

### SIM Retrieval Lambda

Lambda step-by-step flow:

1. Generate 1NCE API token by using credentials stored in the secrets manager
2. Use 1NCE API token to call [Get ALL SIMs](https://help.1nce.com/dev-hub/reference/getsimsusingget) Endpoint.
3. Get All SIMs from Dynamo DB.
4. Compare the lists:
   1. If a SIM that doesn't exist in DB is returned by 1NCE API, then SIM details are being sent to [SIMs create SQS](#sims-createfifo).
   2. If SIM that exists in DB is not returned by 1NCE API, then SIM details are being sent to [SIMs disable SQS](#sims-disablefifo)
5. If any error occurs - failure details are sent to [SNS Failure Topic](#failure-topic)

Cron job:
This lambda is triggered by a cron job defined in the CloudFormation parameters (LambdaCron), by default it will be triggered every day at 1 am to identify SIM changes

Memory size:
This lambda has 3GB of RAM memory to be prepared to fetch and compare thousands of SIMs between the API and Dynamo database.

Execution time:
Depending on your number of SIMs this lambda can take up to 15 minutes because it is fetching all SIMs from the API over the HTTPS protocol and comparing each SIM change with the database

> :warning: **SIM Retrieval Lambda - Load test:**
> Due to the possible high number of devices, this lambda was tested with 15,000 SIM cards and it took about 1 hour to process the creation of all devices. This delay is happening because each new SIM is generating an SQS message and [Create SIM lambda](#create-sim-lambda) takes a while to complete the creation process because it is processing one record per each execution.

### Create SIM lambda

Lambda step-by-step flow:

1. Read the message from [SIMs create SQS](#sims-createfifo).
2. Create a new IoT Core Certificate.
3. Attach IoT Core Policy to the certificate.
4. Create a new IoT Core Thing. SIM cards iccid is being used as Thing name.
5. Attach the Certificate to the Thing.
6. Put SIM details in Dynamo DB.
7. Send a Success message to [SNS Success Topic](#success-topic)
8. Send a message to MQTT topic `registration`
9. If any error occurs - failure details are sent to [SNS Failure Topic](#failure-topic)

The message format for SNS and MQTT:
```
{
  "iccid": "8988280666001099538",
  "ip": "10.242.0.3",
  "timestamp": 1680618078888,
  "message": "SIM enabled"
}
```
### Disable SIM lambda

Lambda step-by-step flow:

1. Read the message from [SIMs disable SQS](#sims-disablefifo).
2. Change the Dynamo DB item. Mark the certificate as inactive `a: false`
3. Send a Success message to [SNS Success Topic](#success-topic)
4. If any error occurs - failure details are sent to [SNS Failure Topic](#failure-topic)

The message format for SNS:
```
{
  "iccid": "8988280666001099538",
  "ip": "10.242.0.3",
  "timestamp": 1680618078888,
  "message": "SIM disabled"
}
```

### Onboarding lambda

Lambda step-by-step success flow:

1. Get the IP address from the request. The IP address is added in request headers by the Nginx server running on the EC2 instance.
2. Find onboarding details (certs, private keys, IoT Core Endpoint URL) for the IP address in Dynamo DB.
3. Validate if the SIM is still active `a: true`
4. Form and return the response:
   1. If header {"content-type": "text/csv"} in the request is present - return the response in CSV format.
   2. If no such header exists return the response in JSON format.
1. If details are not found for the IP in DB, or SIM is not active - return the 404 status code.
2. If an unexpected error occurred - return the 500 status code.

JSON response example:
```
{
  "amazonRootCaUrl": "https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem",
  "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
  "privateKey": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "iccid": "8988280666001099538",
  "iotCoreEndpointUrl": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.iot.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"
}
```

## EC2

[AutoScalingAndLaunchTemplateStack](#autoscalingandlaunchtemplatestack) defines the autoscaling group and launch template for EC2 Instance.

Full EC2 User Data can be found in `scripts/ec2-user-data.bash`

EC2 instance flow:

- Install AWS cli and all required utils.
- Get configured breakout region from SSM parameter. Download the OpenVPN config for the configured breakout region. Config is being downloaded from the public S3 bucket.
- Get OpenVPN credentials from Secrets Manager.
- Start OpenVPN service. Wait till the OpenVPN connection is established and the IP address is assigned.
- Use OpenVPN IP address, to generate onboarding endpoint proxy server endpoint. Put this value in the SSM parameter.
- Get onboarding endpoint from SSM parameter. Get onboarding endpoint x-api-key from api gateway.
- Download the Nginx config template from the public S3 bucket. Fill Nginx config. Run the Nginx server.
- Reboot EC2 instance.

<br />
EC2 instance will send failure message to [SNS Failure Topic](#failure-topic) in such cases:
- Failure to get an SSM parameter
- Failure to put an SSM parameter
- Failure to download configuration file from S3 bucket
- Failure to get a secret from secrets manager
- Failure to get API keys from API Gateway
- If openVPN service will not be able to get tun0 interface within 120s
- If nginx service will fail to be started

Example message:
```
{
  "timestamp":1680526955876,
  "message": "EC2 Nginx server failure"
}
```

<br />
EC2 instance will send success message to [SNS Success Topic](#success-topic) if EC2 configuration will be successfull.

Example message:
```
{
  "timestamp":1680526955876,
  "message": "EC2 instance for onboarding service configured correctly"
}
```
### Connect to EC2 machine.

1. AWS > EC2 > Instances
2. Find EC2 instance with openvpn-onboarding-security-group SG
3. Connect > Session Manager


### Troubleshoot EC2 instance

#### Open VPN
`ifconfig` should show the tun0 interface. If the interface is not there - check the OpenVPN folder:
<br />
`ls /etc/openvpn/` 
<br />
`client  credentials.txt  openvpn-1nce-client.conf  server  update-resolv-conf`

credentials.txt should contain the same content as 1NCE portal > Configuration > OpenVPN Configuration > Download credentials.txt
<br />
In order to validate if openvpn can be started manually the following command can be used:
<br /> 
`sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/openvpn-1nce-client.conf`


More details https://help.1nce.com/dev-hub/docs/network-services-vpn-service

#### Nginx server
Nginx config:
`cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

"proxy_pass" should contain the onboarding endpoint from the SSM parameter.<br />
"proxy_set_header" should set x-api-key for onboarding endpoint.<br />
"proxy_set_header" should set onboarding-ip header.<br />
"resolver" is set to Route53 DNS address (fixed IP 169.254.169.253) in order to keep instances' IPs up to date. Do not change this value.<br />

Nginx logs:
`tail /var/log/nginx/access.log` 


## IoT Core

Following resources are created for onboarding:

1. IoT Core Policy. The policy is attached to all certificates. The policy is being generated with [IOTCorePolicyStack.IotPolicyGenerator](#iotcorepolicystack).
2. IoT Core Certificates. The certificate is being attached to IoT Thing by [Create SIM lambda](#create-sim-lambda).
3. IoT Core Thing. Thing's name matches SIM iccid. The thing is being created by [Create SIM lambda](#create-sim-lambda).


## Resouces per CFN templates

##### IOTCorePolicyStack:
File Name: iot-core-policy.yaml

Lambda and other resources for IoT Core Policy Generation. Lambda is being used here because on stack deletion the Policy shouldn't be deleted, because it could be assigned to some resources. IoT Core Policy allows to subscribe, connect, and publish to MQTT broker topics. The policy is being attached to Certificates generated for each IoT Core Thing.
##### SQSResourcesStack:
File Name: sqs.yaml

[SQS](#sqs) queues.
##### SimTableStack:
File Name: sim-table.yaml

IAM role Allows EC2 instances to get and put SSM parameters, get secrets manager values, and get API Gateway keys. It also allows connecting EC2 instances via AWS Session Manager.<br />
Auto Scaling group defines that there should always be 1 EC2 instance available as an onboarding proxy server.
##### S3BucketAndLocalFilesStack:
FileName: s3-lambda-code.yaml

[Private S3 bucket](#private-s3-bucket-content) used to store code for lambdas. Stack also contains Lambda resources that downloads files from the Public S3 bucket to the Private S3 bucket. Downloaded files contain code for [lambdas](#lambdas). This is needed because lambdas can take code only from S3 buckets that are placed in the same region.<br />
IAM Role allows to download files from the Public S3 bucket and Put them in the Private S3 bucket.
##### SecretsManagerStack:
FileName: secrets-manager.yaml

[Secrets Manager](#secrets-manager) secrets.
##### LambdaInvokeStack:

Custom Lambda and resources to invoke [SIM Retrieval Lambda](#sim-retrieval-lambda). This is done during Stack rollout to get all SIMs from [Get ALL SIMs](https://help.1nce.com/dev-hub/reference/getsimsusingget) Endpoint immediately.
## Building the project

In order to be able to deploy the templates to your S3 Bucket and then use it in the Cloud Formation, it is necessary to build the files beforehand.<br>For that purpose, there is a script developed for Linux systems that will do the job. The script has the following requirements:
- zip unix utility
- yq command-line tool (https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
- Node 18 or newer
- Deployment values file properly filled (deploymentValues.yaml)

The `build.sh` script is located under the `scripts` folder and it can receive two arguments. The first refers to the environment in which the files will be deployed. The second argument is used to pass a version different from the one described in the `deploymentValues.yaml`. That is useful when deploying temporary testable versions.

### Deployment Values

Deployment values is a file located in the root of the repository and has the responsibility to keep shared values used across the templates. Most of them don't need to be touched and are there only because that is a common place for being reused. But, the values of `codeBaseBucket`, `codeBaseBucketRegion`, and `version` needs to be updated before running the script. Those values, except for the `version`, are described under the name of an environment. One can have multiple environments in the file, but each of those needs to have values for `codeBaseBucket` and `codeBaseBucketRegion`. When running the script, the environment should be informed as the first argument and the respective value will be used when reading the file. <br><br>Description of the keys in the deploymentValues.yaml:
- `codeBaseBucket` is the S3 bucket name
- `codeBaseBucketRegion` is the region where the S3 bucket is located
- `version` which will be used as the main folder in the bucket (will be ignored if a second argument is provided to the build script)
- `apiGatewayUrlSSMParamName` is the SSM parameter name where the API gateway URL will be placed
- `onboardingPathSSMParamName` is the SSM parameter name where the onboarding endpoint path will be placed
- `proxyServerSSMParamName` is the SSM parameter name where the proxy server address will be placed
- `breakoutRegionSSMParamName` is the SSM parameter name where the VPN breakout region will be placed
- `openVPNCredentialsSecretName` is the AWS Secrets name where the OpenVPN credentials will be placed.
- `onboardingApiKeyName` is the name of the API Key used in the Onboarding API Gateway.
- `snsSuccessTopicName` is the SNS topic name where success messages will be published
- `snsFailureTopicName` is the SNS topic name where failure messages will be published

### The script

The build script starts by checking and extracting the values from `deploymentValues.yaml`. Then, all the node dependencies will be installed using `npm ci` just before bundling and zipping it. Finally, all the files will be moved to the build folder, and values extracted from `deploymentValues.yaml` placed in the right spots. Now, the project is ready to go.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh {{ENVIRONMENT}} {{VERSION}}
```

## CFN Templates publishing to the AWS S3 bucket

For Device Onboarding stack rollout all CFN templates and other supporting files must be uploaded to the public S3 bucket. For convenience, S3 bucket with the publicly available script files is already created and available for everyone interested to try this solution. In case if customer wants to host his own S3 bucket, there is available a special Shell script  to publish all files `./scripts/publish.sh`.

Prerequisites before running the script:
- AWS S3 bucket with "Public" access rights is created
- Non expired AWS credentials are available for AWS CLI under default profile, with the rights to upload files to the S3 bucket
- yq command-line tool (https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
- Solution is compiled and prepared in the build folder using `./scripts/build.sh` script
- `deploymentValues.yaml` file is available and contains version number and name of the `codeBaseBucket` under according environment name


Following command can be used:
```sh
sudo ./scripts/publish.sh dev V1.0.2 latest
```
Script input parameters:

|Parameter Index | Parameter name  | Mandatory   | Description |
|----------------| --------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1              | environment     | Yes           | parameters group name from the `deploymentValues.yaml` file. Will use  `codeBaseBucket` value from that group |
| 2              | version-number  | No            | Non mandatory parameter, default value will be taken from `version` value in `deploymentValues.yaml` file. All files are uploaded to folder with the name of this parameter on S3 bucket |
| 3              | latest          | No            | Non mandatory parameter, if provided uploads `device-onboarding-main.yaml` file to the latest folder in the bucket |

    sudo snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
    sudo snap install certbot-dns-route53
    ```

4. Add these lines at the end of the nginx configuration file to listen on port 80 and this server will be used to generate the ssl certificate.
   Nginx configuration file location: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`:
    ```
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;
        root /var/www/html;
        server_name _;
    }
    ```

5. Restart ngnix server
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

6. Generate [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) ssl certificate

    1. Set AWS credentials
        - Create AWS config file
            ```
            cd ~
            mkdir .aws
            sudo nano .aws/config
            ```

        - Fill in and save this file with the IAM user information created in section 2
            ```
            [default]
            aws_access_key_id=REPLACE_WITH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
            aws_secret_access_key=REPLACE_WITH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            ```

    2. Generate [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) ssl certificate.
       Values to be replaced:
        - REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN: Domain used to generate the SSL certificate (example: domain.com)
        - REPLACE_WITH_EMAIL: Email to subscribe [Let's Encrypt expiry notifications](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/)

        ```
        cd ~
        certbot certonly --dns-route53 -d REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN --logs-dir ~/letsencrypt/log/ --config-dir ~/letsencrypt/config/ --work-dir ~/letsencrypt/work/ -m REPLACE_WITH_EMAIL --agree-tos --non-interactive --post-hook "sudo systemctl restart nginx"
        ```

7. Update nginx configuration (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`) to add ssl certificate
    1. Update the listen port to 443 (default https port) and add the `ssl` tag to the server listen ports.
        Note: If you want, you can set another https listen port    
        ```
        listen 443 default_server ssl;
        listen [::]:443 default_server ssl;
        ```
    
    2. Add certificate and key to the NGINX configuration inside of the `server` object at the same level as `root` and `server_name`.
        ```
        ssl_certificate /home/ssm-user/letsencrypt/config/live/REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /home/ssm-user/letsencrypt/config/live/REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN/privkey.pem;
        ```

    3. After updating the nginx configuration file should look like this:
        ```
        server {
            listen 443 default_server ssl;
            listen [::]:443 default_server ssl;

            root /var/www/html;

            ssl_certificate /home/ssm-user/letsencrypt/config/live/REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem;
            ssl_certificate_key /home/ssm-user/letsencrypt/config/live/REPLACE_WITH_DOMAIN/privkey.pem;

            server_name _;
            location / {
                    proxy_pass                  REPLACE_WITH_API_GATEWAY_URL;
                    proxy_set_header            onboarding-ip $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                    proxy_set_header            x-api-key REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY;
                    proxy_ssl_server_name       on;
            }
        }

        server {
            listen 80 default_server;
            listen [::]:80 default_server;
            root /var/www/html;
            server_name _;
        }
        ```

8) Restart ngnix server
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

9) Test automatic renewal
    ```
    cd ~
    certbot renew --dns-route53 --logs-dir ~/letsencrypt/log/ --config-dir ~/letsencrypt/config/ --work-dir ~/letsencrypt/work/ --non-interactive --post-hook "sudo systemctl restart nginx" --dry-run
    ```

# Delete and cleanup process

If the stack is being deleted, then the majority of resources will be deleted by the CFN stack. Some of the resources still need to be cleaned/deleted manually:

- IoT Core Things
- IoT Core Certs
- IoT Core Policy

if HTTPS support has been implemented:
- IAM policy
- IAM user
- Route 53 `A` or `AAAA` record

# FAQ

Q: My SIMs were migrated to a different 1NCE organization and stopped working.<br />
A: If SIMs were migrated to a different 1NCE organization, this means that SIM will not be returned via [Get ALL SIMs](https://help.1nce.com/dev-hub/reference/getsimsusingget) Endpoint. Therefore [SIM retrieval lambda](#sim-retrieval-lambda) will send an SQS message to disable the SIM. SIM is being disabled by setting the certificate in DynamoDB as `a: false`. When onboarding will be called for such SIM card a message `{"message":"Device with the IP=1.2.3.4 is not active"}$` with 404 status code will be returned.

Q: My HTTPS setup was done with success but it stopped to work.<br />
A: It's a manual process and if the EC2 server shuts down for any reason, autoscaling will replace the old instance with a new one. Once this new instance is live, the HTTPS process must be repeated.
